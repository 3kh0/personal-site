      <p>Wait, people want to know stuff about me?</p>

        Well ok. To my family, I am the official tech support. Have a problem? Ask me! I started coding when I was 6. I was still using block coding at the time but I have taken a greater interest in actual coding. I am talking cabout HTML,
        CSS, and Javascript. I wanted to learn more so I went to the god almighty google and searched for coding courses. I never took any kid coding classes because they were still doing block coding. I bought a big CSS book that is about
        500 pages. I spent a whole week reading and studying. Still, I suck at it. If anyone knows CSS please DM me on discord so I can make my site look a little better.

        Then I got access to my dad's computer. It was a fairly new iMac. Before I was using an old MacBook air that whenever I opened up Visual Studio Code, the fans would go crazy. The iMac could run many programs at once without
        triggering the fans. I was just coding random scripts and did not release them because they were buggy as heck. Then I got into GitHub. I put some of my projects up there. I started working to host all of my projects on GitHub. It
        was a very plain site. On the homepage, it only had 3 links to projects. I started adding games to the site and other fun stuff I made. I hope to do more!
